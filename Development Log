Description: The object method cannot detect if the player is standing at the edge of the platform.
Details: Change to use extra collider to detect if the player is standing on the ground.
Note: Still finding a better way to do this.

2022/04/30: [Zachary Fan] [Other]
Details: The method I used on 04/28 is not the right array method. The right one is called Raycast
Note: Change the log on 04/28

2022/04/30: [Zachary Fan] [Other]
Details: Mess up the Project when trying to reset the version. Reimport the whole project.

2022/04/30： [Zachary Fan] [Learn] [Add art resources] [Code Optimization] [Add features] 
Description: Use new PlayerSheet. Implement crouch. Optimize Jump. Use Raycast to detect ground.
Details: Use simpler art resources for future development. Use some Jump Optimization to improve Jump. Use Blend tree to simple the animation logic.
         Add Crouch to PlayerController.
Note: Since I reimported the whole project, some functions that were reimplemented may be different from before.

2022/05/01：[Zachary Fan] [Debug] [Add Codes]
Description: Complete jump and fall animation. Debug Jump() in PlayerController.
Details: Use sub-state to implement hit ground animation. Fix the bug: holding the jump button will cause continuous jump animation when landed.
